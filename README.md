----------------------------
 - **Percolation.java** : A model for the percolation problem, determines if a 2d system of open / closed sites percolates from top to bottom.
 - **PercolationStats.java** : Generates statistics using the percolation model.

Week 2 - Queues, Stacks and Bags
--------------------------------
 - **Deque.java** : A generic double ended queue implementation, double-linked list based.
